Implementations of alghorithms and data structures in rust and pure c presented in Introduction to Alghorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein. Wherever help was used from someone others code it is noted in the comments.
The goal is purely to further educate myself after getting my degree. Some algorithms where implemented in various ways, some were not mentioned in the book but still implemented, some excerises from 
the book were not implemented some were, this is a self-taught course using 3 main resources: 1.the before mentioned book; 2.https://catonmat.net/summary-of-mit-introduction-to-algorithms; 
3.Knuth's Concrete Mathematics book
wqupc.rs is a remainder from the coursera Alghorithms and has not yet been tested.
